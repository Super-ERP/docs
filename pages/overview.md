The app itself lives in `apps/web` (a pnpm workspace under the repo root). Local-dev
and CI commands run from the repo **root** — the root `package.json` scripts
delegate to `--filter web`, so you don't need to `cd apps/web`.

## Local development
```bash
cp .env.example .env            # sensible localhost defaults; Microsoft optional for email login
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up -d   # local Postgres 17 on :5432 (matches .env.example)
pnpm install
pnpm run db:generate             # (already generated; re-run after schema changes)
pnpm run db:setup                # apply migrations + RLS + views, then seed
pnpm run dev                     # http://localhost:3000
```
> `docker-compose.dev.yaml` runs **only** Postgres for local dev; the app itself runs on the host via `pnpm run dev`. If you already have a Postgres 17 elsewhere, point `DATABASE_URL` (the RLS-enforced `crm_app` role) and `DATABASE_ADMIN_URL` (the superuser, for migrations + seed) at it instead. `crm_app` is created by `db:setup`.
The seed creates a **Demo Entity** and a demo Owner login (printed at the end, default `admin@demo.local` / `Password123!`).

To start with a populated demo (extra logins + sample customers/funnels/quotations) instead of an empty entity, use the seeded setup — same as `db:setup`, plus `db/seed-sample.ts` layered on top:
```bash
pnpm run db:setup-seeded         # migrations + RLS + views + base seed + sample data
```
This adds four more logins under the Demo Entity (all password `Password123!`) and a set of sample customers, contacts, funnels, quotations, a won project, and leads to play with:

| Email | Role | Tier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `admin@demo.local` | Owner (superadmin) | 100 |
| `manager@demo.local` | Manager | 60 |
| `sales1@demo.local` | Rep | 20 |
| `sales2@demo.local` | Rep | 20 |
| `viewer@demo.local` | Viewer | 10 |

The sample seed is idempotent and **dev-only** — don't run it on an internet-exposed deployment (it mints well-known default credentials). It is intentionally not part of the production Docker `migrate` step.

## Signed client release images

Client releases come from annotated strict SemVer tags such as `v1.2.3`.
`.github/workflows/release-images.yml` builds Linux AMD64 and ARM64 images for
the web runtime, migrator, encrypted-backup runtime, and deployment agent on GitHub-hosted
runners. It pushes each build by immutable digest first, blocks on High or
Critical Trivy findings, creates an SPDX JSON SBOM and maximum-mode BuildKit
provenance, then signs and verifies the digest with GitHub OIDC and Cosign.
Only verified digests receive the version and source-commit tags.

The workflow publishes a `release-manifest-<tag>` artifact containing each
GHCR repository and digest, source commit, workflow signing identity, and build
time. All four client image values must come from that manifest and retain the
`ghcr.io/...@sha256:...` form. Tags are discovery labels, never deployment
coordinates. The source-free bundle under `deploy/client/` verifies the exact
workflow identity before pulling any image.

For audits, the authoritative release-history file is maintained in:

```text
docs/operations/release-log.md
```

## Production

Production uses the pull-only, Cosign-verified bundle in `deploy/client/`.
Follow [`deploy/client/README.md`](https://github.com/Super-ERP/crm-v2/blob/main/deploy/client/README.md); do not build the
source Compose stack on a client production host.

## Operator workspace

Vendor operators onboard and maintain client deployments in the protected
control-plane UI. Create the client, current contract, and deployment; open the
deployment workspace; issue its one-time install token; then register, configure,
review, sign, and verify its heartbeat. Use the same workspace to issue a new
immutable signed version after a contract, configuration, or approved-release
change. See [operator onboarding, signing, and recovery](/operations#operator-workspace-client-onboarding-and-signing).

This is an operator workflow, not a customer or integration-partner interface.
No documentation update records a live deployment or signed release; only
completed `release-images` runs append to the [release log](https://github.com/Super-ERP/crm-v2/blob/main/docs/operations/release-log.md).

## Upgrade notes

The following are **intentional** behavior changes from this hardening pass. Operators
upgrading an existing deployment should review them before applying migrations.

- **Existing tenants are not locked out of password login.** Migration `0015` backfills
  `tenant_settings.allow_password_login = true` for every tenant that still had the old
  default of `false`, now that the flag is actually enforced at sign-in. SSO-only stays
  opt-in: a tenant can turn password login back off afterward.
- **`MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID` must be a real directory GUID.** The multi-tenant value
  `common` is no longer accepted (single-tenant hardening); in production the app refuses
  to boot if Entra is configured with `common`. Set your Entra directory (tenant) GUID.
- **The Entra redirect URI changed.** It is now
  `${BETTER_AUTH_URL}/api/auth/oauth2/callback/microsoft-entra-id`; the old `/callback/`
  rewrite was removed. **Re-register this exact URI in the Azure app registration** or
  sign-in will fail.
- **Exactly one superadmin is allowed.** A partial unique index permits a single
  superadmin row. **Before applying migration `0012`, demote any extra superadmins**, or
  the migration will fail. For break-glass, use direct DB access to flip the flag.

## Architecture notes
- **Data access** flows through `withTenant(permission, (tx, ctx) => …)` (`lib/actions.ts`), which authorizes then opens a tenant-scoped transaction.
- **Business rules** live in `server/services/*` (stage/approval state machine, quotation math, lead conversion) — no `next/*` imports, reusable beyond the web layer.
- Middleware (`proxy.ts`) is optimistic-redirect only; real auth is enforced in every Server Action / Route Handler.
