# Quandatics CRM — Docs site

A [Zudoku](https://zudoku.dev) static docs site for the Quandatics CRM
developer/operator documentation. Built with npm (isolated from the app's pnpm
workspace).

## Run locally

```bash
cd docs-site
npm install
npm run dev        # local preview with hot reload
npm run build      # static build → dist/
npm run check:docs # verify every route/plugin has a registered product page
```

## Single source of truth

**Overview**, **Contributing**, and **Modules** are copied from the repository
root at build time by `scripts/sync-root-docs.mjs` (wired as `predev`/`prebuild`).
Edit the **root** files — `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `MODULES.md` — not
`pages/overview.md`, `pages/contributing.md`, and
`pages/extensibility/plugin-system.md` (those are regenerated copies).

`pages/operations.mdx` and `pages/architecture.mdx` are authored here directly.
The Operations page is a short public index. Detailed deployment and recovery
commands remain in the public repository's `OPERATIONS.md` so one runbook stays
canonical.

## Adding a product capability

1. Add one canonical page under
   `pages/product/<domain>/<capability>.mdx`.
2. Register its route, schema, permissions, plugin flag, and page in
   `catalog/modules.json`.
3. Add the page to `zudoku.config.tsx`.
4. Run `npm run check:docs`.

The build fails if a plugin flag is undocumented, a catalog page or route is
missing, or a catalog page is absent from navigation.

## External developer access

The public **External developers** section is for partners integrating through
stable contracts instead of CRM internals. It documents API usage, sandbox expectations, key handling,
support flow, and the current read-only boundary. Do not publish server access,
database credentials, restricted contributor instructions, or production secrets.

Source contributors use the public repository's `CONTRIBUTING.md`; a fork is
enough to open a pull request. Repository visibility never grants production,
database, secret, or server access.

## Deploy to Vercel

The `docs-quality` GitHub Actions workflow is the only production deployment
mechanism. Do not run manual production deployments for routine releases.

1. Create the Vercel project and set **Root Directory** = `docs-site`.
2. Add its token as the `VERCEL_TOKEN` GitHub Actions secret.
3. Keep the Vercel organization and project IDs in `docs-quality.yml` aligned
   with that project.

Pull requests must pass the `docs-quality` verification job before merge. After
the change reaches `main`, that same workflow verifies the merge commit and
creates exactly one production deployment from the checked-out source.
If GitHub does not emit the expected push run, manually dispatch `docs-quality`;
the workflow still verifies `main` before deploying.
